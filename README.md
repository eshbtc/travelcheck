# Travel History Tracker for Citizenship Applications

A comprehensive system to automatically compile international travel history from passport stamps, email confirmations, and flight tracking data for USCIS citizenship applications and other immigration purposes.

## üéØ Problem Statement

USCIS requires applicants to list all international trips lasting 24+ hours over the past 5 years. Many countries don't stamp passports at entry/exit, making it difficult to reconstruct accurate travel histories. This system solves this by:

- **OCR Processing**: Extract dates and locations from passport stamps
- **Email Integration**: Parse flight confirmation emails from Gmail/Office365
- **Flight Tracking**: Cross-reference with apps like Flighty
- **Data Validation**: Cross-check multiple sources for accuracy
- **Report Generation**: Create USCIS-compliant travel history reports

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Gmail API integration (OAuth2)
   - Microsoft Graph API (Office365)
   - OCR via Google Cloud Vision + Document AI
   - Flight tracking API integration

2. **Processing Engine**
   - Email parser for flight confirmations
   - OCR text extraction and validation
   - Data normalization and deduplication
   - Cross-reference validation

3. **User Interface**
   - Secure authentication
   - Document upload interface
   - Travel history review/edit
   - Report generation and export

4. **Data Storage**
   - Encrypted user data storage (Firestore + Storage)
   - Audit logs for compliance
   - Backup and recovery

### Technology Stack

- Backend: Firebase Functions (Node.js callable functions)
- Frontend: React/Next.js with Tailwind CSS
- Database: Firestore with security rules; Storage for files
- OCR: Google Cloud Vision + Document AI
- APIs: Gmail API, Microsoft Graph API
- Cloud: Google Cloud Platform (Firebase)
- Security: Firebase Auth, App Check, OAuth2; tokens encrypted at rest

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Firebase CLI
- Gmail API credentials
- Microsoft Graph API credentials
- Document AI processor IDs

### Installation (Firebase-only)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd travel-check

# Install dependencies
cd functions && npm install && cd ..
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..

# Configure environment
cp env.example .env
cp functions/env.example functions/.env  # optional for local emulators

# Run frontend locally
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Optionally run Firebase emulators (Auth/Firestore/Storage)
# firebase emulators:start

# Deploy (requires Firebase project configured)
# firebase deploy --only functions,hosting,firestore:rules,storage
```

Note: The previous FastAPI backend has been removed. Legacy backend steps are no longer required.
