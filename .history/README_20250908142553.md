# Travel History Tracker for Citizenship Applications

A comprehensive system to automatically compile international travel history from passport stamps, email confirmations, and flight tracking data for USCIS citizenship applications and other immigration purposes.

## üéØ Problem Statement

USCIS requires applicants to list all international trips lasting 24+ hours over the past 5 years. Many countries don't stamp passports at entry/exit, making it difficult to reconstruct accurate travel histories. This system solves this by:

- **OCR Processing**: Extract dates and locations from passport stamps
- **Email Integration**: Parse flight confirmation emails from Gmail/Office365
- **Flight Tracking**: Cross-reference with apps like Flighty
- **Data Validation**: Cross-check multiple sources for accuracy
- **Report Generation**: Create USCIS-compliant travel history reports

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Gmail API integration (OAuth2)
   - Microsoft Graph API (Office365)
   - OCR engine (Tesseract + custom models)
   - Flight tracking API integration

2. **Processing Engine**
   - Email parser for flight confirmations
   - OCR text extraction and validation
   - Data normalization and deduplication
   - Cross-reference validation

3. **User Interface**
   - Secure authentication
   - Document upload interface
   - Travel history review/edit
   - Report generation and export

4. **Data Storage**
   - Encrypted user data storage
   - Audit logs for compliance
   - Backup and recovery

### Technology Stack
